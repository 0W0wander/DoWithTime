# DoWithTime
Todolist with timer assigned to each task. Whenever you try to create a task you will need to add a time duration associated with it. and you can also reorganize tasks. then there is the do screen where it shows the topmost task. and has like a big ol play button. so you can start that task and the timer will start going down. if you finish a task it'll be a ten second timer transition to the next task. if you don't finisht the task in time a really loud noise will start playing. 

you can also customize the noise later to set it to something inappropriate like women moaning so you have to do it in time. it should also have a notification like the clock app where it allows you to stop/pause/reset it from the notifications bar.
